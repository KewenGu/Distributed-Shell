There're 6 files included in this project client.c, server.c, client.h, server.h, Makefile, and clients.txt which contains client username and password.
There's also a bash script file call script.sh used to test network performance.

Use command "make" to compile the files.
After making the program,
to run the server, enter "./server"
to run the client, enter "./client -s [server address] -c [command you want server to run]"

The default port number is 4074, and the default username is "kgu", with the password "407485831"
